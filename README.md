# DigForWhat

This repository contains the code used for making the app [DigForWhat](https://vftgustav.shinyapps.io/DigForWhat/).<br/> 
DigForWhat is an interactive app that lets you explore ancient findings in Denmark from the dataset [Fund og Fortidsminder](https://www.kulturarv.dk/fundogfortidsminder/).<br/>

The app was created by [Frida](github.com/frillecode/), [Marie](github.com/marmor97), and [Gustav](github.com/guscode/) as a part of our exam in [spatial analytics] at [Aarhus University](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/da/course/101991/Spatial-Analytics).
