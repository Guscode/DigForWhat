# DigForWhat data

The shapefile for the __Fund og Fortidsminder__ data is too large for Github, why it should be downloaded here:

When downloading it, please select the following
- Geometritype: Punkter
- Format: ESRI Shapefile
- Referencesystem: LÃ¦ngde-bredde/WGS84

Files in this folder:
- municipality_mil_united.shp: shapefile containing polygons of municipalities
